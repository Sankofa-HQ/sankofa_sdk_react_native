/// A non-intrusive touch interceptor that captures interactions for session replay.
///
/// By using a `UIGestureRecognizer` attached to the key window with `cancelsTouchesInView = false`,
/// we can observe all touch events without swizzling or interfering with the app's UI.
///
/// ## Critical Implementation Notes
/// 1. We MUST transition `.state` through `.began → .changed → .ended` so the
///    system doesn't cancel our recognizer when other gesture recognizers fire.
/// 2. `cancelsTouchesInView`, `delaysTouchesBegan`, and `delaysTouchesEnded` are
///    all set to `false` so the app's own gesture system is completely unaffected.
